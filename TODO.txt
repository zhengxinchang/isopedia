X1. fuison gene search
X2. search funciton 优化
X3. external sort of tmp idex
    currently took 32G for 172 sample merging task(18min)
X4. add metadata looking up funciton
    annotation line starts with #
    # sample meta1..
    # s1. m1..
    
X5. fusion gene batch search by providing a bed file of breakpoints
X6. fusion gene search by provide a bed file of gene regions[discovery mode]
X7. merge different isoform.gz from replicates
X8. confident value
X9. change the constant sample size to dynamic.
X10 min-read should only affect the postive count
X11 change gini to depend on CPM 

X build index gencode
build index sg-nex
build index sra 
X replace randam read with mmap
Subset results
Gff output
X Improve readme and release
add search SJ addtional to input GTF
X --cach-size in GB for preheat memmap2
X --lru size also included.
X warmup size need to be adjusted
check chrom distribution before aggregation
X anno-isoform shouldnt drop any queries.
standarize the breakpoints between the anno-fusion and anno-splice
use record type to mark if the record from mono-exon, then each split if a record is combined from a mono exon and two exon but share same SJ. extramely rare event?? 


AS 1 query

report all possible reads

output format
SJ_id, AS_id in the input file
SJ left chrom
SJ left pos
SJ right chrom 
SJ right pos 
SJ support evidence
number of exon ??
Mached JS in the isoform
dist to  match SJ? 
isofrom tss left most
isoform tss right most
isoform tes left most
isoform tes right most
SJs in isoform
SJ isoforms sample column
    supprot read count
    tss/tes,
    strand
